A Simple XML->NSObject Mapper for iOS

---
This is Version 0.01. Please read the [wiki](https://github.com/kechan/KEXMLNSModel/wiki) page for more details. This code has been tested with iOS 6.0 and XCode 4.6.3.
This is a young project, so please be patient with bugs, limitations, and other immaturities.

###What is KEXMLNSModel?
It is a convenient mapper that helps with mapping an XML message to a hierarchy/tree of NSObject-based
objects, with as little repetitive coding as possible. This project depends on [GDataXMLNode](https://github.com/neonichu/GDataXML). I am a newbie in terms
of sharing code (open source). Right now, I am just dropping in the 2 files (GDataXMLNode.h, .m) and ran with it.
Veterans, please guide me with the best practice and how this should be attributed, licensed, etc, etc?

More to come...
